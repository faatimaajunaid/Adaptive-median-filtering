Adaptive median filtering on images containing salt n pepper noise

A selective adaptive median filter is proposed for the restoration of gray scale images that are highly corrupted by salt and pepper noise. After detecting the salt and pepper noise pixels, the self-adaptive median filter is use to find a suitable window containing more non-noise pixels.
